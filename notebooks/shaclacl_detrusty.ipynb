    "## SHACL-ACL: Access Control with SHACL\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from the query plan shown above for the GDP and CO<sub>2</sub> emission, many operations and requests to the knowledge graphs are necessary in order to answer the query. In the case of star-shaped sub-query decomposition, the query is decomposed into seven sub-queries. Each of these sub-queries can be answered by either World Bank or Wikidata as indicated by the colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SHACL-ACL?\n",
    "\n",
    "SHACL-ACL [\\[10\\]](#10) is a policy-based access control approach capable of controlling the access of SPARQL [\\[1\\]](#1) query execution over RDF [\\[2\\]](#2) knowledge graphs. The access control policies are expressed in SHACL [\\[3\\]](#3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why SHACL-ACL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Private data and computational resources on the Web need to be protected against unauthorized access. The _Open Digital Rights Language_ (ODRL) [\\[4\\]](#4) is designed for that purpose. However, the evaluation of ODRL policies is not explained in the specification and, hence, the semantics of different implementations may not be the same. Additionally, only data from the policy or known to the evaluation system can be considered for reaching a conclusion whether the access should be granted or denied. SHACL-ACL relies exclusively on concepts and techniques well-known in the Semantic Web community. Using SHACL to specify the access control policies gives the benefit of a clear semantics for the policy evaluation [\\[5\\]](#5). Furthermore, utilizing the _RDF Mapping Language_ (RML) [\\[6\\]](#6), SHACL-ACL can consider external data during the decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does SHACL-ACL work?\n",
    "\n",
    "When receiving a SPARQL query, SHACL-ACL creates a virtual KG with the data necessary for the policy validation. In order to create said virtual KG, RML mappings are utilized. The access control policies specified in SHACL are then validated against the virtual KG. If the validation result contains at least one violation, the access is denied and an error will be returned. If the virtual KG confirms with the access control policies, i.e., no violations were detected, the access is granted. When the access is granted, the SPARQL query is executed and the query result will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the code of SHACL-ACL is imported, and some reoccurring variables are set.\n",
    "SHACL-ACL uses the following tools:\n",
    "  - a modified version of the SDM-RDFizer [\\[7\\]](#7) for collecting JSON data from Web APIs and returning an RDFLib graph (i.e., a virtual KG) instead of generating a file with the RDF triples\n",
    "  - Trav-SHACL [\\[8\\]](#8) for validating the SHACL shape schema\n",
    "  - DeTrusty [\\[9\\]](#9) for executing the SPARQL query if the access is granted"
